# Welcome to AresLabs!

As a provider of physical security for properties on Mars, we are always striving to bring the best and most innovative
solutions to our clients. As part of this effort, we have developed a digital aspect to our services, including a vert.x
gateway wrapper to help manage and secure your Martian property.

This documentation covers the various event types and responses available through the vert.x gateway wrapper. It is
designed to help you understand the functionality of the wrapper and how to effectively use it to protect your Martian
property.

We hope this documentation serves as a helpful resource as you utilize the vert.x gateway wrapper and the other digital
security tools we offer at AresLabs. If you have any questions or need further assistance, please don't hesitate to
reach out to our team. We are here to help you keep your property safe and secure.
